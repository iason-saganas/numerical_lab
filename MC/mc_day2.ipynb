    "<h1> Monte Carlo simulation - limb darkening in plane-parallel, grey atmospheres </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Limb darkening describes the fact that a (normal) star seems to be darker at the edge than at its center. This can be clearly observed for the sun. If, as in Example 1.13, the direction cosine (i.e., the cosine of angle between radius vector and photon direction) is denoted by $\\mu$, one can approximiate the angular dependency of the specific intensity (see below) by the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(\\mu) ≈ I_1(0.4 + 0.6 \\mu) \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_1$ is the specific intensity for the radial direction, $\\mu = 1$, i.e., the intensity observed at the center of a star. For $\\mu = 0$, on the other hand, the angle between radial and photon’s direction is 90$^{\\circ}$  (this condition is met at the limb of the star), and the corresponding region appears to be fainter, by a factor of roughly 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eq.(1) is the consequence of an approximate solution of the equation of radiative transfer in plane-parallel symmetry (i.e., under the condition that the stellar photosphere is very thin compared to the stellar radius: the solar photosphere, e.g., is only a few hundred kilometers thick, contrasted to the sun’s radius of 700 000 km), with absorption and emission processes assumed to be grey, i.e., frequency independent, which has been developed  by Eddingtion and Barbier. \n",
    "Note that the approximate solution of Milne’s integral equation (Example 1.13) is based on the same approach. Just one additional comment: The above relation (1) has nothing to do with the presence of any temperature stratification (though it can be influenced by it), but is the consequence of a large number of absorption and emission processes in an atmosphere of finite (optical) depth, as we will see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid almost all subtleties of radiative transfer and corresponding approximate solutions, in this exercise we will perform a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the above result. The principle strategy is very close to the simulation as described in Example 1.13, but we will sort the photons according to the direction they leave the atmosphere, and not according to their energy.\n",
